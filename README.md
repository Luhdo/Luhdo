## About Me

Hello there! My name is Ludho Mohammadpour, a passionate individual with a deep love for JavaScript. I am currently pursuing my studies in Computer Engineering, and I'm excited to combine my technical skills with my creativity to build awesome applications and APIs.

On my GitHub profile, you will primarily find JavaScript projects as it is my preferred programming language. While most of my projects are currently set as private, I strive to make them available to the public as soon as I consider them finished.

I have a penchant for coming up with cool ideas, and I keep a collection of ongoing projects that I can quickly finalize when the need arises. I believe in the power of experimentation and continuous learning to enhance my skills and deliver innovative solutions.

Oh, and I have a soft spot for triangles. They are not only geometrically fascinating but also symbolize balance and harmony for me.

Feel free to explore my repositories, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or if you'd like to collaborate on an exciting project. Happy coding!
